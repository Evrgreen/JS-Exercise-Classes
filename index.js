  EXAMPLE TASK:

    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property gets set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property gets set to false.

  // I-a takeOff Method sets isFlying property to true when called

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person class whose constructor initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should also initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:

        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  STRETCH PROBLEM (no tests!)
    - Extend the functionality of the Student by adding a prop called grade and setting it equal to a number between 1-100.
    - Now that our students have a grade build out a method on the Instructor (this will be used by _BOTH_ instructors and PM's) that will randomly add or subtract points to a student's grade. _Math.random_ will help.
    - Add a graduate method to a student.
      + This method, when called, will check the grade of the student and see if they're ready to graduate from Lambda School
      + If the student's grade is above a 70% let them graduate! Otherwise go back to grading their assignments to increase their score.
